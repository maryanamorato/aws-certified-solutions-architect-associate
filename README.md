# aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate

Study Material (only in Portuguese, at least for now) for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C02) certification. Based on the documentation available at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ and in the AWS FAQ section https://aws.amazon.com/faqs/

Everything here is like writing in progress. Many concepts are still missing, but the base is very good!

I am totally open to contributions and creation of issues. I hope this material can help someone!

Good studies!
